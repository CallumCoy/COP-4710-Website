Work Journal for Website

Monday October 8th

	Completed ER diagram with basic requirenments, also includes some extra things that would be nice if I could implement into the system.  Also Completed the SQL create file to make all of the tables (although untested).  Next time I want to construct a todo list to keep track of what needs to be done, and I can cross stuff off as I go.  Also would be nice to set up my main desktop to run a server, rather than having to use my personal server.  Finally put in the create tables and hope it will work.  From there I will likely design the pages next.
